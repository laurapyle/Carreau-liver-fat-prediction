# Background

The purpose of this analysis is to determine which variables best predict hepatic steatosis (HS) in adolescent girls with PCOS.  Candidate variables included BMI %ile, waist circumference, HOMA, HDL, TG, ALT, free testosterone, and SHBG.

# Methods

A logistic regression model with the outcome of HS and all candidate predictor variables was fit.  Next, backwards stepdown elimination with total residual AIC as the stopping criteria was used to identify variables that best predict HS.  The bootstrap (with 200 bootstrapped samples) was used to validate the model and to correct the over-optimism of the model.  A bootstrap validation was also performed on the full model to compare the results to the reduced model.  Finally, an intermediate model using $\alpha$=0.5 as the criterion to remain in the model was compared to the full and reduced model.

# Results

There were `r N` subjects included in this analysis.

The results of the full logistic model are shown below.

```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(tab1)
```

Backwards stepdown elimination was used to identify a reduced model, described below:

```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(tab2)
```

The reduced model was validated using 200 bootstrapped samples:
```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(v[1:11,1:5])
```

For comparison, the full logistic regression model was also validated using 200 bootstrapped samples:
```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(vfull[1:11,1:5])
```

Based on the table above, the reduced model results in better out of sample prediction.  An intermediate model using $\alpha$=0.5 as the criterion to remain in the model was compared to the full and reduced model:  

```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(tab3)
```

The intermediate model was validated using 200 bootstrapped samples:
```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(v5[1:11,1:5])
```

The intermediate model has the best out of sample prediction of the three models.

The intermediate model was used to create a nomogram, which is a way to obtain the predicted probability of an outcome (in this case, HS) for an individual based on their covariate values.  To use the nomogram, draw a vertical line between the individual's value of each covariate and the point axis to obtain the number of points for each covariate.  Sum the points for the individual covariates to get the total points.  Draw a vertical line from the total points to the probability axis to get the predicted probability of HS for the individual.

Predicted probabilities of HS were obtained from the intermediate model.  ROC analysis was used to identify the cutoff of the probability of HS that maximized the Youden Index.  The ROC plot is shown below, along with the optimal cutoff and corresponding sensitivity and specificity.  The AUC for this model is `r roc$auc`.

```{r, results='asis',tidy=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
plot.roc(roc, legacy.axes=TRUE, xlim=c(1,0), ylim=c(0,1))
kable(coords(roc, "b", ret=c("t","specificity","sensitivity"), best.method="youden")) # default
```

The output below provides additional information regarding the performance of the predictive model, using this specified cutoff.

```{r,  echo=FALSE}
conf
```

ROC analysis was then used to identify the cutoff of the probability of HS that maximized sensitivity.  This cutoff and associated performance of this predictive model is shown below.

```{r,  echo=FALSE}
summary(opt.cutoff.sens)
```

ROC analysis was then used to identify the cutoff of the probability of HS that maximized resulted in 90% NPV.  This cutoff and associated performance of this predictive model is shown below.

```{r,  echo=FALSE}
summary(opt.cutoff.NPV)
```
